    <h1>The Moment I Fell in Love with Thailand</h1>

    <h3>The Food, The Islands, and the Smiles</h3>
    <hr />
    <p>Literally right before the world shut down, due to Covid, my friends and I had the pleasure of vacationing in
        Thailand.
        We visited Bangkok for a couple of days, where we toured the beautiful temples and ate some of my favorite Thai
        dishes.
        We also flew down to Phuket and stayed a couple of days there as well. Where we island hopped the beautiful Phi
        Phi Islands.
        What a breathtaking site! Here is a list of some activities during the trip.
    <ul>
        <li>Temple Tour, Bangkok</li>
        <li>Fly to Phuket</li>
        <li>Go to Bangla Road</li>
        <li>Island Hop Phi Phi Island</li>
        <li>Eat Well!</li>
    </ul>
